# Wordcounter Chrome Extension!


### Reference
[word counter](https://wordcounter.net/)

### Roadmap
- [ ] get the basics chrome extension down 
- [ ] UI first? or functionality of word counting logic?
- [ ] connecting the UI to the mouse cursor highlight to js
- [ ] 

- we have the enabled button
- we highlight the word/sentence/paragraph
- we open the popup again
- it 'automatically?' has the wordcounts/analytics
    - does the algo run upon clicking the button?
    - or constantly?
- using the wordcount.net - extra added functions *


### MVP
- at least the counter of the words
